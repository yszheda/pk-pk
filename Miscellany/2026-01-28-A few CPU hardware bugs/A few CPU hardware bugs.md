Catherine (Whitequark)’s recent [observations on poorly](https://crackhead.technology/) [\-engineered firmware](https://social.treehouse.systems/@whitequark/115946915331426694) reminded me of a few mistakes I’ve seen in vendors’ CPUs; some unimportant and others surprisingly bad. Since I’ve never seen these widely discussed, here’s some discussion and links to supporting evidence to make them more widely known, since I think they’re interesting.

## Intel’s misspelled CPUIDs

I’m aware of two situations where Intel have sold CPUs that report misspelled names in some of the strings returned by the [`CPUID` instruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPUID). This seems embarrassing for an organization of Intel’s size, but probably doesn’t hurt anybody’s ability to use the CPUs in question.

### GenuineIotel

A web search for “GenuineIotel” reveals some discussions regarding this apparent typo, where some processors such as the [Xeon E3-1231 v3](https://instlatx64.github.io/InstLatx64/GenuineIotel/GenuineIotel00306C3_Haswell_CPUID5.txt) return the string “GenuineIotel” (instead of the usual “GenuineIntel”) for the CPU manufacturer ID. This one is well-known enough to be mentioned in the list of manufacturer IDs on Wikipedia.

It’s possible this misspelling is actually caused by some kind of random bit error, since the characters ’n’ and ‘o’ differ by only one bit; an unpredictable error that sets that bit could change `GenuineIntel` to `GenuineIotel`.

### ore i5

Another error that seems more likely to be human error in the CPU is in the Core i5-1245U CPU, which returns a processor brand string `Intel(R) ore(TM) i5-1245U` which is simply missing the ‘C’ in `Core(TM) i5`. Web searches for “Intel(R) ore(TM)” show a number of results which could be errors introduced by non-technical users attempting to copy down text from their screen when asking for tech support, but the [Ubuntu certified configuration of the Dell Latitude 5430 with this CPU](https://ubuntu.com/certified/platforms/12916) attests to this error actually being present in at least some machines using that CPU.

It’s possible this misspelling is not part of the physical CPU design and is instead part of the system firmware because [at least on many AMD CPUs the CPU name is normally set by the system firmware](https://chipsandcheese.com/p/why-you-cant-trust-cpuid). Probably either the CPU design or its microcode encode this misspelling, or Intel’s firmware package that vendors use is the ultimate source. In either case, it seems embarrassing for them that such an error made it out into machines purchased by members of the public because it seems very likely to be the result of human error.

## ITE’s pipeline bug

This one is an actual hardware bug that I discovered at work, but in an embedded processor which most people will never see.

[ITE Tech](https://www.ite.com.tw/en) is a Taiwanese chip company that sells a variety of specialized ICs, including a selection of PC embedded controllers (which are used for tasks like making the keyboard work and managing battery charging in most laptops). [IT81202](https://www.ite.com.tw/en/product/cate2/IT81202) is one of those, with on-chip peripherals for communicating with an x86 processor and plenty of memory for private use by its RISC-V CPU.

It turns out there’s a pipeline bug in the IT81202 CPU, where [instructions modifying some registers immediately following a multiply (`mul` instruction) may have no effect](https://web.archive.org/web/20220531074654/https://www.ite.com.tw/uploads/product_download/it81202-bx-chip-errata.pdf). The workaround for this is to cripple the system, telling your compiler that the CPU doesn’t support multiplication or division instructions. Some of the performance can be regained by [providing implementations of the library functions that provide integer multiply/divide operations that work in terms of the `mul` and `div` instructions](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/zephyr/pull/45881), which works because inserting no-op instructions after them prevents the issue.

To me, this issue doesn’t seem as embarrassing as Intel’s wrong CPUIDs. Pipelined CPUs are hard to build, and at the time they designed the IT81202 CPU RISC-V wasn’t widely used in industry yet so they probably had a pretty immature core implementation. In addition, that’s an embedded processor which very few people will ever need to write software for so an invasive workaround like that isn’t a big deal. This one seems more like a cautionary tale to be aware of than any reason to mock the vendor!
